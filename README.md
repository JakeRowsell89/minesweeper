# MineSweeper

An exploratory exercise to get some familiarity with ReactJs and Webpack. 

[Let's sweep some mines](https://jakerowsell89.github.io/minesweeper/)

### Prerequisites

This project requires Node v7.4.0+ (lower versions at own risk) and npm

### Installing

Clone the repository from github

```
git@github.com:JakeRowsell89/minesweeper.git
```

From inside the repository install the modules 

```
npm install
```

Build the source files into web-ready JS files

```
npm run build
```

You can also watch files in the `app/` directory for changes
```
npm run dev
```

You can directly access the local url on your computer via web browser e.g. 
`file:///Users/jakeroswell/dev/minesweeper/dist/index.html` 


## Deployment

This currently doesn't support any deployment as that would be overkill.
